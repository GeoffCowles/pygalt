1.) need to update the find element to be more efficient 

2.) Create a standardized test case - use oscillating solid-body rotation.  Particles start start 
  on a line along y=0, x> 0, move with velocity field of solid body rotation, and oscillate back
  to the exact starting point.  

3.) need to move to 3D but have option for 2D using vertically-averaged, surface, or bottom fields

4.) need to upgrade the advection to 4 stage RK 

5.) need to add horizontal and vertical random walk

6.) need basic routine to handle trophodynamic modeling

7.) tuning - block size tuning, maintaining local/global vars
